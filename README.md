# vlass2caom2
Application to generate a CAOM2 observation from VLASS FITS files

# Issues
- there's no position information in the fits files
- the obs id I picked is too long
- what are the cardinality rules?
- cd11 - change RA by that many degrees to the right
- cd12 - change the dec by that many degrees 
- cd21 - change the ra
- cd22 - change the dec

# Information
- all VLASS data is public as confirmed from Erik via JJ on May 29/18
